        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 1/2 gallons peanut oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors
                    in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire
                    extinguisher handy, just in case.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at
                    least 1 inch in diameter. Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both
                    the outside and the inside. Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey. Maintain the
                    temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the
                    internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.</p>
                </li>
